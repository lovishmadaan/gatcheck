This directory contains the code for multi-class node classification on the PPI dataset. Run the following script to reproduce the results reported in the paper:
```bash
$ bash run.sh
```

You can also change the parameters in `run.sh` script and the list of parameters is available in `train_ppi.py`. `visual.ipynb` Jupyter notebook contains the code for graph visualization and plotting the histograms for attention weights distribution. You can experiment with the various parameters present in the file.
